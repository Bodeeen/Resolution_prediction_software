- Physical pinhole function is not correct? Gives inf resolution sometimes... Scaling?

- For camera we need to redefine the read-out noise. We could define per pixel but then need to recalculate according to nr
of pixels used. Could be fairly easily done from the pihole function image. Calculate sum of image and scale with ration between
scanning step "pixel size" and camera pixel size. I.e. pinhole function defined with 20x20 nm2 pixels and has a sum of 10 then
total read out noise would be 10 * (20*20)/(65*65) if camera pixel size is 65x65 nm2. It's maybe a bit rought but should be
mostly ok...
Alternativly recalculate pinhole fcn with camera pixel size directly.
