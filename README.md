# Resolution Prediction Software

## Requirements
 - Python 3.7 or later
 - The packages specified by [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Running the command
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder of the repo will install these. If you have
   any issues with pip failing to build the packages on Windows, you may find prebuilt versions
   [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs).
 - If you are using Windows, the numpy build that's available on PyPI may have issues even if it
   installs correctly. Therefore, you may need to install the build available
   [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy). 

## Running the application
In the root folder of the repo, run the command `python -m frcpredict` to launch the software.
