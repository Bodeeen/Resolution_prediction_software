Cross section

The value set here determines the rate of ON-switching induced per kW/cm2 of light intensity. The rate of ON-switching is calculated as the cross section
times the illumination power given in kW/cm2. The unit for the cross section is thus rate/(kW/cm2).


Spectral power

The FRC value is based on the expected properties of the Fourier transform of the output image. From the image formation model empoyed, the Fourier transform
of the output image depends on the properties of the Fourier transform of the underlying fluorophore density. To calculate the FRC value at a certain frequency,
the spectral power of the underlying fluorophore density at that point needs to be known. In reality every unique fluorophore density map has a specific
spectral power and an experimentally measures FRC curve depends on what sample is being imaged. In order to predict an absolute resolution value, it is thus necessary
to define/assume a spectral power curve of the sample. In these simulations, the spectral power curve is assumed to be constant at every non-zero frequency. This constant
value can either be set manually in the "Spectral power" edit box or estimated as the average spectral power of an example fluorophore density map using the
"Load sample structure..." button.
